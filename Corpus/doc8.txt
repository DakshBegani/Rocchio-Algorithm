In a future ravaged by ecological disaster, Earth is on the brink of collapse. Massive dust storms sweep across farmlands, crops are failing, and humanity faces extinction due to a global food crisis. Former NASA pilot Cooper, now a widowed farmer raising two children, Tom and Murph, grapples with the hopelessness of the world he will leave behind for them. Murph, a curious and scientifically gifted child, believes their house is haunted by a mysterious presence that manipulates gravity. When strange gravitational anomalies lead them to a set of coordinates hidden in binary code, Cooper and Murph discover a secret NASA facility headed by Dr. Brand, a physicist working on a plan to save humanity.

Dr. Brand reveals that a wormhole appeared near Saturn decades ago, placed there by unknown beings, and it opens a path to another galaxy with potentially habitable planets. A previous mission, the "Lazarus missions," sent astronauts through the wormhole to scout twelve candidate worlds. Now, NASA is planning a final mission to investigate the three most promising ones: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann. Cooper is reluctantly recruited to pilot the spacecraft *Endurance* alongside Brand's daughter, Amelia, physicist Romilly, geographer Doyle, and two AI robots, TARS and CASE. Although Murph pleads with him not to leave, Cooper departs in hopes of securing a future for her and the human race.

The journey through the wormhole is perilous, and the team lands first on Miller’s planet, a world orbiting dangerously close to a black hole named Gargantua. The planet is covered in shallow water and experiences extreme time dilation—every hour spent there equals seven years on Earth. A catastrophic tidal wave forces them to abort the mission, but the delay results in the loss of 23 years in Earth time. They return to *Endurance* to find Romilly aged and weary. Murph, now a brilliant scientist working with Dr. Brand on Earth, discovers that Brand's promise of solving the gravity equation and enabling humanity's escape was a lie—his Plan A was never viable. Plan B, seeding a new human colony with embryos on a distant world, was the only real plan.

The crew visits Dr. Mann’s planet next, but Mann has falsified data to be rescued, and he betrays them in desperation. In a tense confrontation, Mann’s actions lead to his own death and damage to *Endurance*, forcing Cooper to sacrifice himself by detaching his lander to slingshot Amelia and the embryos toward Edmunds’ planet. Cooper falls into Gargantua and finds himself inside a five-dimensional tesseract created by the mysterious beings—who are revealed to be a future evolved form of humanity. Inside this extradimensional space, he communicates across time with young Murph through gravitational manipulation—the "ghost" in her room—giving her the data from inside the black hole to solve the gravity equation and save humanity.

The tesseract collapses once Cooper has fulfilled his mission, and he awakens near Saturn, rescued by humans now living on a massive space station named Cooper Station, named in honor of Murph. He reunites briefly with Murph, now elderly and celebrated for saving humanity. Knowing she has her family and that his place is no longer there, Murph encourages him to find Amelia, who has landed alone on Edmunds' planet to begin a new colony. As the film ends, Cooper steals a spacecraft and sets out to reunite with her, suggesting that hope, love, and the unyielding human spirit remain the most powerful forces in the universe.

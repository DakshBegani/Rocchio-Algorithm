Inception is a cerebral sci-fi thriller centered on Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in the rare art of extracting secrets from people’s subconscious during dreams. Cobb is not just any thief—he invades dreams to steal valuable corporate secrets, using cutting-edge dream-sharing technology. However, he’s haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal, whose projection in dreams threatens to sabotage his missions. Cobb is a fugitive, unable to return home to his two children in the United States, and desperate for a way to clear his name.

His opportunity comes when powerful businessman Saito offers Cobb a unique job—not extraction, but inception: planting an idea so deeply within a person’s subconscious that they believe it is their own. The target is Robert Fischer, heir to a vast energy empire, and the goal is to plant the idea that he should break up his father’s company. If Cobb succeeds, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb's criminal record. Cobb assembles a team: Arthur, his trusted partner and point man; Ariadne, a gifted young architect who designs the dream worlds; Eames, a cunning forger who can impersonate people within dreams; and Yusuf, a chemist who prepares the sedative needed for such a deep dream.

The plan involves entering multiple layers of dreams—dreams within dreams—to make the inception convincing. Each level is more unstable and dangerous than the last. They board a flight with Fischer and begin the operation. As they descend through layers of consciousness, the dream environments become increasingly surreal and perilous, distorted by time dilation and the fragile balance of shared dreaming. Complications arise, including the appearance of Mal's projection, a manifestation of Cobb’s guilt over her death, which threatens to derail everything. The team must complete the inception and escape through synchronized "kicks" (events that jolt them awake) in each layer before they are lost in limbo, a deep subconscious space where time is nearly infinite.

Throughout the mission, the emotional stakes intensify. Ariadne discovers Cobb’s buried memories and guilt over Mal’s suicide, which he unwittingly caused by planting the idea in her mind that her world wasn’t real. The mission succeeds after an intense series of action-packed sequences across dreamscapes: a city bending on itself, a zero-gravity hotel, a snowy mountain fortress, and finally, limbo. Cobb confronts Mal’s projection one last time, choosing to let go of her so he can return to reality and his children. Meanwhile, Fischer wakes with the seed of the idea planted deep in his mind, believing he must create something new instead of inheriting his father's empire.

Cobb wakes on the plane, and Saito honors his word. At immigration in L.A., Cobb is cleared, and he rushes home to see his children. In the film’s famously ambiguous final scene, Cobb spins his totem—a small top used to test whether he’s dreaming or awake. As it spins on the table, the camera lingers... and just as it begins to wobble slightly, the screen cuts to black. The audience is left questioning whether Cobb truly escaped the dream—or chose to believe he had.

Fifty-year-old Tony Stark drifts alone through space in the dying remnants of the Benatar, oxygen running low, his body frail, and his spirit wavering. He records a final message for Pepper Potts, reflecting on the cost of heroism, the beauty of life on Earth, and the love he carries despite the weight of failure. Stark believes this is the end. But when all hope seems lost, a blinding light pierces the void—Captain Marvel arrives, answering the call from Earth. She carries Tony and Nebula back to the planet where the Avengers regroup, broken and still mourning the catastrophic loss brought by Thanos’s snap.

On Earth, the Avengers are fractured. Steve Rogers leads a support group, trying to offer others the strength he barely clings to himself. Natasha Romanoff operates a global surveillance effort, while Bruce Banner—now merged with the Hulk in both brain and brawn—seeks peace. Thor has retreated into isolation, numbing his guilt with alcohol in the fishing town of New Asgard. When Tony returns, he and Pepper settle into quiet domesticity, raising their daughter Morgan on a lakeside farm. Five years have passed since the Decimation, and though the world has learned to live with loss, the Avengers have not.

One day, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm—where he was trapped during the snap—thanks to a curious rat triggering the machinery. To him, only five hours have passed. He rushes to the Avengers compound, frantic and alive with the possibility that time might be the key to fixing everything. The Avengers regroup and bring the idea to Tony, hoping quantum physics can help them retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past. Initially reluctant to jeopardize the family he’s finally found, Tony has a change of heart, cracked by the memory of Peter Parker and inspired by a photo of him. He perfects time travel and re-joins the Avengers with one mission: retrieve the stones, undo the snap, and bring everyone back.

The Avengers split into teams and journey across time. Natasha and Clint return to Vormir to find the Soul Stone, unaware of the terrible sacrifice it demands. In a heartbreaking act of selflessness, Natasha gives her life so that Clint can return with the stone. Tony, Steve, Bruce, Rocket, Thor, Nebula, and Rhodey gather the remaining stones from moments in the team’s shared history—from the Battle of New York, to Asgard, to Morag—battling old enemies and confronting past versions of themselves. Along the way, Steve sees Peggy Carter through a window and Thor reconnects with his mother, both reminded of the things they lost in pursuit of saving others.

Back in the present, the team builds a new gauntlet. Hulk, whose strength and gamma exposure make him the only one capable of wielding the stones, snaps his fingers—and a pulse of life spreads across the Earth. But before they can celebrate, a version of Thanos from 2014, tipped off by Nebula’s shared memory link, arrives with his warship. He rains fire on the Avengers compound, destroying it and burying the team in rubble. In the chaos, Tony, Steve, and Thor confront Thanos in a brutal, desperate battle. When all hope seems lost, portals open across the battlefield—Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and all the heroes who vanished begin to emerge. The Avengers, finally assembled, charge into one last battle to save their world.

Amid the war, the gauntlet changes hands until it reaches Tony. With a final, defiant look at Thanos, Tony snaps his fingers, sacrificing himself to dust Thanos and his entire army. The cost is immense—Tony dies with Pepper at his side, comforted by her words: “You can rest now.” The world mourns a hero who gave everything. At his funeral, friends, allies, and even rivals gather by the lake to honor the man who started it all.

In the film’s closing moments, Steve Rogers returns the stones to their rightful places across time. But he doesn’t come back through the machine. Instead, he chooses to live a life in the past—one he had earned but never taken. As an old man, he reappears on a bench nearby, having spent decades with Peggy Carter. Smiling, he passes his shield—and the mantle of Captain America—to Sam Wilson, entrusting the future to new hands.

Back in time, in a quiet house in the 1940s, Steve and Peggy sway slowly to a long-awaited song in their living room. The world outside rages on, but for now, in that still moment, they dance. The story that began with loss ends with love—and the quiet fulfillment of a promise long overdue.

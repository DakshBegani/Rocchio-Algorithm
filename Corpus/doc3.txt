Plot Summary – The Godfather (1972)
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel by Mario Puzo.

The story follows the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch of the Corleone mafia dynasty in post-World War II New York City. When Vito refuses to join a drug operation proposed by a rival gangster, he becomes the target of an assassination attempt. This sparks a series of events that destabilize the family’s power and draw his youngest son, Michael Corleone, into the world of organized crime.

Initially, Michael wants nothing to do with the family's criminal business, but after his father is nearly killed, he murders a corrupt police captain and rival mobster in retaliation and flees to Sicily. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., tensions escalate between the crime families.

After Vito recovers, he attempts to restore peace between the families, but when Vito dies of natural causes, Michael takes over as the new Don. In a climactic ending, Michael orchestrates the murder of all the family's enemies during the baptism of his godson, solidifying his position as the new ruthless head of the Corleone family.

The film ends with Michael fully transformed—no longer the innocent outsider, but now the feared and respected Don Corleone. As his wife Kay watches in disbelief, the door to his office closes, symbolizing her exclusion from his new world and the chilling completion of Michael’s descent into the heart of darkness.

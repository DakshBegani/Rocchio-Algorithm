Doug Billings is two days away from his wedding. He’s calm, reliable, and just the right amount of boring—the kind of guy who pays his bills early and trims his lawn with military precision. But for one weekend, his best friends decide it’s time he let loose. So they pile into a vintage Mercedes and head for Las Vegas: Doug, his shy soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan, his sarcastic schoolteacher buddy Phil, and the straight-laced dentist, Stu.

They check into Caesar’s Palace, get a suite the size of a house, and toast on the rooftop under the neon glow of the Strip. Shots are poured. Jokes are made. And then—

—cut to morning.

The suite looks like a crime scene. There’s a chicken in the living room. A tiger growls from the bathroom. Stu is missing a tooth. Alan’s wearing a jockstrap. And Doug? Doug is gone.

None of them remember a thing.

As panic sets in, the trio begins retracing their steps through a city that chewed them up and spit them out. They find a hospital bracelet, a stolen police car, and a baby named Carlos. They discover that Stu married a stripper named Jade during the blackout. Alan may have drugged them all by slipping roofies into the shots—he thought it was ecstasy.

Each breadcrumb leads to another wild reveal. They face down an angry gangster named Mr. Chow, who emerges from the trunk of their car naked and wielding a crowbar. They crash a wedding chapel, impersonate cops during a school field trip, and get beaten by a bunch of taser-happy children. Somehow, in the middle of it all, a friendship strengthens—a dysfunctional, disaster-fueled bond that neither gambling nor hangovers can erase.

As the hours tick down, they uncover that Doug isn’t kidnapped, lost, or dead—he’s been stranded on the hotel roof the whole time, sunburned and dehydrated. The weekend was supposed to be legendary, and it delivered. Just not the way anyone expected.

With barely enough time, they speed back to L.A., arriving just in time for the wedding—sunburns, missing teeth, and all. Doug gets married. Stu dumps his controlling girlfriend. Phil goes home to his wife with a story he’ll never tell her. And Alan? Alan finds a digital camera in his pocket with the full photo record of the lost night.

But they all agree: they’ll look at the pictures once—and then delete them forever.

Or so they say.
